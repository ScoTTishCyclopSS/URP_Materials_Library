# URP Materials Library

A library of various kinds of procedurally (and not only) generated materials in Unity Engine using URP for the final thesis.

## Description

The shader graph tool was used to create materials in unique styles, drawing inspiration from various games. 
The demo consists of a test scene where materials from the sample album can be easily exchanged. 
Each material is equipped with parameters that influence the real-time display and can be adjusted by the user at any moment.
